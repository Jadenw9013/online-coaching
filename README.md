## 🧠 Core Philosophy

Steadfast is built around one principle:

> Every page should answer “What do I do next?” in under 5 seconds.

No clutter.  
No confusion.  
No admin-style dashboards.  

Just clarity and action.

---

## 🏗 Architecture Overview

### Frontend
- Next.js (App Router)
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Clerk (Authentication)

### Backend
- Next.js API Routes
- Prisma ORM
- PostgreSQL (Neon/Supabase)
- Supabase Storage (private buckets)

### AI / Processing Pipeline

Meal Plan Import Flow:

1. File uploaded to private Supabase bucket
2. Server generates signed upload URL
3. Google Cloud Vision OCR extracts text
4. OpenAI structures meal plan into JSON
5. Schema validation + normalization
6. Draft meal plan created
7. Coach reviews and publishes

All secrets remain server-side.

---

## 🔐 Security & Privacy

- Private Supabase storage buckets
- Signed upload URLs only
- No secrets in client code
- Role-based route protection
- Environment variables managed in Vercel
- Google Vision budget + quota capped
- LLM output validated before persistence

This is beta software. No medical claims are made.
